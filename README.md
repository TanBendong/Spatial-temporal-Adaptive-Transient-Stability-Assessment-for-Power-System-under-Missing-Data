# Spatial-temporal-Adaptive-Transient-Stability-Assessment-for-Power-System-under-Missing-Data
These are codes for our paper "Spatial-temporal Adaptive Transient Stability Assessment for Power System under Missing Data", and the following introduction provides usage for them. As the capacity of github is limited, we apologize that the datasets cannot be uploaded, but readers can gernerate them according to data generation method in our paper. Enjoy it!
## Relief_FT
* main.m: The main program of feature importance calculation. Its input is training data, and output is importance of each temporal features.
* Relief_FT: Program of feature importance calculation, called by main.m
* weights.mat: The results of main.m
